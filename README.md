# ML-in-Image

The notebook contains machine learning models on:
1. Image Classification: multi-label classifier using neural network
It involves the extraction of information from an image and then associating the extracted information to one or more class labels. It is more of a supervised learning task.


2. Image Segmentation: It is an important step in image processing, and it seems everywhere if we want to analyze whatâ€™s inside the image. It is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple distinct regions containing each pixel(sets of pixels, also known as superpixels) with similar attributes.
