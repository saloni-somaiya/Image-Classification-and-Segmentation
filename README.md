# ML-in-Image

The notebook contains machine learning models on:
1. Image Classification: multi-label classifier using neural network
It involves the extraction of information from an image and then associating the extracted information to one or more class labels. It is more of a supervised learning task.

Used TensorBoard that provides visual insights into the events that occur during training at each epoch.


2. Image Segmentation: It is an important step in image processing, and it seems everywhere if we want to analyze whatâ€™s inside the image. It is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple distinct regions containing each pixel(sets of pixels, also known as superpixels) with similar attributes.

Installed jupyter notebook on DataProc Cluster and deployed the model on Google Cloud platform for better performance and GPUs.
